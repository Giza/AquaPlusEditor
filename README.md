## AquaPlusEditor - v2.0
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForumHulp/pageaddon.svg?branch=master)](http://vnx.uvnworks.com)


This tool is focused to translate the .bin files of the Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen


Support BIN, PAK, FNT

Tested With: Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen

## Notes:
The repacker to PSV/PS4 format isn't tested.

You don't need Encrypt the .sdat after decrypted, the game can read without encryption.

The FNT is unstable, I think will works only with the Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen

This tool can't edit the .tex files from the Steam version
(LZ77 Algorithm outdated, if someone give-me a complete implementation of the LZ77 in C# I can add support)
